devices.


SUBTHEMING
----------
While we tried to add as much functionality in the admin settings, you may want
to make more customizations to this theme using code.  Do not make any code
changes to this theme directly or you will not be able to update to the next
theme version.  Instead, you should subtheme this theme.
